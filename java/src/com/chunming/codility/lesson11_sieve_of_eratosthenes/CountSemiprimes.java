  Count the semiprime numbers in the given range [a..b]

  Assume that:

  N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
  M is an integer within the range [1..30,000];
  each element of arrays P, Q is an integer within the range [1..N];
  P[i] â‰¤ Q[i].

  Complexity:

  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(log(N))+M);
  expected worst-case space complexity is O(N+M).
