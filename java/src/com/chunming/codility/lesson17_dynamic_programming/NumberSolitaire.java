  In a given array, find the subset of maximal sum in which the distance between consecutive elements is at most 6.

  Assume that:

  N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
  each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’10,000..10,000].

  Complexity:

  expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
  expected worst-case space complexity is O(N)
