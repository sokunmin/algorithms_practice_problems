  Count the minimum number of nails that allow a series of planks to be nailed.

  Assume that:

  N and M are integers within the range [1..30,000];
  each element of arrays A, B, C is an integer within the range [1..2*M];
  A[K] â‰¤ B[K].

  Complexity:

  expected worst-case time complexity is O((N+M)*log(M));
  expected worst-case space complexity is O(M).
